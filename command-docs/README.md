# Research Engine Command

Transform any research question into comprehensive, actionable insights with AI-powered automation.

## What It Does

The Research Engine automates the tedious process of gathering information from multiple sources, analyzing patterns, and extracting insights. Perfect for:

- **Developer Research**: Find pain points and opportunities in frameworks and tools
- **Market Analysis**: Understand trends and user sentiment
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Analyze what others are doing in your space
- **Technical Discovery**: Research implementation approaches and best practices

## How It Works

1. **Submit Your Brief**: Describe what you want to research in natural language
2. **AI Discovers Sources**: Automatically finds relevant GitHub repos, Reddit discussions, and more
3. **Deep Analysis**: AI extracts pain points, opportunities, and patterns
4. **Get Insights**: Receive a structured report with actionable findings

## Example Use Cases

### Finding Developer Pain Points
```
/research "What are the main pain points developers face when deploying React applications to production?"

- **Flexible Depth**: Quick (5-10 min), Standard (15-30 min), or Deep (45-60 min)
- **Export Options**: Notion database, Markdown, or JSON
- **Async Processing**: Start research and check back later
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Not just data collection, but insight extraction

## Getting Started

1. Run the `/research` command
2. Enter your research brief
3. Choose depth and sources
4. Get your job ID
5. Check status with `/research-status [jobId]`
