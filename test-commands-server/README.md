# test-commands-server

MCP server created with basic template

Created with [create-commands-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-commands-mcp)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env

# Set your Commands.com organization (required for usage tracking)
npx create-commands-mcp set-org <your-commands-org>
# Example: npx create-commands-mcp set-org johndoe

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test your server
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

## Available Tools

- **ping** - Test server connectivity
- **echo** - Echo back user input  
- **datetime** - Get current date/time in various formats
- **usage** - Check your Commands.com usage limits and consumption

## Development

### Adding New Tools

### Quick Start

1. **Create a new tool file** in `src/tools/`:

```typescript
// src/tools/myTool.ts
export const myTool = {
  name: "my_tool",
  description: "Does something useful - be specific for better AI usage",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      input: { 
        type: "string", 
        description: "Clear description helps AI understand when to use this tool" 
      }
    },
    required: ["input"]
  },
  handler: async (args: { input: string }) => {
    // Your tool logic here
    return { 
      success: true,
      result: `Processed: ${args.input}`,
      // Return structured data when possible
    };
  }
};
```

2. **Export from** `src/tools/index.ts`:

```typescript
export { myTool } from './myTool';
```

3. **Test your tool**:
```bash
npm run dev  # Start server
npm run doctor  # Verify tool registration

# Test via REST endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp/tools/my_tool \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"params": {"input": "test value"}}'

# Test via JSON-RPC endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "my_tool",
      "arguments": {"input": "test value"}
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```

### Tool Design Best Practices

- 📝 **Clear descriptions** - AI needs to understand when to use your tool
- 🔧 **Specific input schemas** - Define exactly what parameters you need
- ✅ **Error handling** - Return meaningful error messages
- 📊 **Structured output** - Consistent response format helps AI usage
- 🚀 **Performance** - Keep tools fast (< 30s timeout recommended)

### Token Accounting & Usage Tracking

**What is this for?** When your MCP server is deployed to Commands.com's marketplace, the platform tracks usage to:
- Enforce tier-based limits (free/pro/enterprise users)
- Provide usage analytics to developers
- Handle billing for premium features

**Do I need this?** 
- ✅ **For local development**: No, everything works without configuration
- ✅ **For Commands.com marketplace**: Yes, required for usage tracking and billing
- ✅ **For self-hosted/private use**: No, you can ignore these features

#### Usage Stats Tool
The built-in `usage` tool lets users check their Commands.com tier and consumption:
```bash
# Via REST API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp/tools/usage \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

Returns:
- Current tier (free/pro/enterprise)
- Usage limits based on tier
- Current consumption (daily/monthly)
- Remaining quota for free tier users

#### Job-Level Token Accounting

**When to use**: For expensive operations (AI calls, large data processing) where you need to:
- Track token/resource usage per operation
- Report usage back to Commands.com for accurate billing
- Implement usage-based features or limits

**Example use cases**:
- AI model calls (track tokens used)
- Data processing jobs (track compute time)
- External API calls (track request counts)

For long-running operations, use the included utilities:

```typescript
import { jobStore, countTokens } from './utils/tokenCounter.js';
import { notifyJobComplete } from './utils/gatewayNotify.js';

// Create a job with token tracking
const job = await jobStore.create({
  userId: 'user123',
  operation: 'data_processing',
  state: 'pending',
  input: userInput
});

// Process and track tokens
const output = await processData(userInput);
const completedJob = await jobStore.complete(job.id, output);

// Notify gateway with token usage
await notifyJobComplete(
  job.id,
  jwt,
  completedJob.tokenCount.total,
  durationMs
);
```

See `src/tools/asyncExample.ts` for a complete implementation example.

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Health check
npm run doctor
```

### Building

```bash
# Build TypeScript
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Commands.com Integration

### JWT Validation (Works Immediately)

Your server automatically validates Commands.com JWTs using public JWKS:

```bash
# No setup required - works out of the box
npm run dev

# Test with any Commands.com JWT token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/ping
```

### Gateway Integration (Optional)

To list your server on Commands.com and receive gateway traffic:

1. Deploy your server to any hosting platform (Railway, Vercel, AWS, etc.)
2. Register at [Commands.com Creator Portal](https://commands.com/creator/mcp-servers/new)
3. Configure your server's proxy URL in the Commands.com UI
4. Commands.com gateway routes user requests to your self-hosted server
5. You handle all server hosting and scaling

```bash
# Verify configuration
npm run doctor
```
