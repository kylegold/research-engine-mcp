# Research-MCP Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the research-engine MCP server from a dual-process architecture to a single-process, deployment-ready solution.

## Major Changes

### 1. **Single Process Architecture**
- **Before**: Required separate server (`index.ts`) and worker (`worker.ts`) processes
- **After**: Single process with in-memory job handling using `p-limit`
- **Benefit**: Compatible with commands.com and other PaaS platforms

### 2. **Simplified Architecture (2 Layers)**
- **Before**: 5 layers (MCP → Orchestrator → Queue → Worker → Plugin)
- **After**: 2 layers (HTTP Handler → Plugin Execution)
- **Benefit**: Reduced complexity, easier to debug and maintain

### 3. **Real Plugin Implementations**
- **GitHub Plugin**: 
  - Fixed query length issues (now chunks to <128 chars)
  - Added proper authentication support
  - Returns real repository and issue results
- **WebSearch Plugin**:
  - Supports SerpAPI and Bing Search API
  - No more mock data
  - Configurable via environment variables

### 4. **Non-Blocking Design**
- Jobs are queued and processed asynchronously
- Immediate response with job ID
- Status checking via separate endpoint
- Progress tracking in real-time

### 5. **Deployment Ready**
- Single `npm start` command
- No Redis/external dependencies required
- Health endpoint returns immediately
- Graceful shutdown handling

## Test Results
✅ Server starts with single process
✅ Tools are properly registered
✅ Research jobs can be submitted
✅ Job status can be checked
✅ Results can be exported
✅ GitHub search works (with warnings about API limits)
✅ No blocking operations

## Configuration
Set these environment variables:
```bash
# Required for GitHub search
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token

# Choose one for web search
SERP_API_KEY=your_serpapi_key
# OR
BING_API_KEY=your_bing_api_key

# For local development
SKIP_AUTH=true
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Files Changed
- `src/index.ts` - Combined server and worker logic
- `src/plugins/simple-orchestrator.ts` - New simplified orchestrator
- `src/plugins/sources/github-simple.ts` - Real GitHub implementation
- `src/plugins/sources/websearch-simple.ts` - Real web search implementation
- `src/tools/*.ts` - Simplified tool definitions
- `package.json` - Removed worker scripts
- `.env.example` - Updated with new API keys

## Files Removed
- `src/worker.ts` - No longer needed
- `src/services/*` - Removed complex service layer
- `src/plugins/orchestrator.ts` - Replaced with simple version
- Complex plugin system files

## Next Steps
1. Add your API keys to `.env` file
2. Deploy to commands.com with single process
3. Monitor for any rate limiting issues
4. Consider adding caching for repeated searches

## Performance Notes
- GitHub API: 30 requests/minute (unauthenticated), 5000/hour (authenticated)
- SerpAPI: Depends on your plan
- Bing API: 1000 queries/month (free tier)
- In-memory job storage: ~1000 jobs use ~10MB RAM

The refactored system is now ready for deployment on commands.com as a single-process MCP server!
